Pit-bikes have appeared in 90-ies, in California. They became very popular around the world. When you say “pit bike”, you should understand that you mean a device with a horizontal four-stroke engine. At the start, there were a variety of models of such brands as Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha.

If the first pit-bikes had 10-inch wheels, small frame, short-stroke suspension, the modern generation is radically different from them. The size of most pit-bikes was increased so that they fit any adult person. Now it can even be called a sports bike, as the gearbox has 4 speeds. The maximum speed can exceed 100 km/h. All pit-bikes are manufactured in China. They can be equipped with Italian forks and brakes, original steering wheels, but the frame and most likely the rest (70%) are made in China.

The desire of many people to ride an off-road motorcycle greatly complicates the selection process. In the salons are sold motorbikes of all classes, but it is the off road vehicles segment, which is showing significant growth. Therefore, all the important manufacturers have released their own models in this segment.

The situation is similar with pit-bikes, as the market have already acquired a number of brands that regularly put all new and new models. However, not every company can boast of regular improvements or at least post sales customer support.
